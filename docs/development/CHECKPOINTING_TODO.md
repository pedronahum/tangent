# Checkpointing Implementation - Status and Next Steps

## Executive Summary

**Current Status**: Phase 4a complete and working ✅ (limited to
`for i in range(n)` loops with a constant, zero-based range; other loops fall
back to the standard full-tape path)
**Memory Reduction**: 2.8% overall (97% reduction in target storage only)
**Gradients**: 100% correct for eligible loops ✅ (`range(start, stop)` loops
are excluded from checkpointing because the adjoint reconstructs the target
as a zero-based index)
**Optimization**: `checkpoint=True` composes with `optimized=True` (the old
force-disable in `grad_util` was lifted once DCE paired tape pushes with
their pops)

**For 99% memory reduction**: Phase 4b requires additional 40-115 hours of effort with architectural changes to tangent's reverse AD system.

## What's Been Achieved

### Phase 4a: Selective Target Storage (COMPLETE) ✅

**Implementation**: what ships is Stage 3 (the checkpointed templates in
`grads.py`, dispatched from `reverse_ad.visit_For`) plus the runtime helpers
in `checkpoint_helpers.py`/`checkpointing_simple.py`. Stages 1, 2, 4 and 5
below described an experimental pipeline that was never wired into the
public API and has since been **removed from the tree** (see "Files and Code
Locations"); the descriptions are kept for historical context.

1. **Stage 1**: CheckpointAnalyzer (274 lines) — removed
   - Analyzes loops for checkpointing opportunities
   - Computes optimal √n checkpoint positions
   - Tracks modified variables
   - Estimates memory savings

2. **Stage 2**: CheckpointPreprocessor (508 lines) — removed
   - Transforms loops with checkpoint infrastructure
   - Extracts loop bodies as module-level functions
   - Creates checkpoint position dicts
   - Handles single and multiple modified variables

3. **Stage 3**: Checkpointed Templates in grads.py (64 lines)
   - `@primal_checkpointed(gast.For)` - stores targets at √n positions
   - `@adjoint_checkpointed(gast.For)` - pops from checkpoints, reconstructs others
   - Integrated with tangent's template system

4. **Stage 4**: Integration Layer (380 lines) — removed
   - High-level API: `enhanced_grad()` and `grad_with_checkpointing()`
   - Analysis and preprocessing pipeline
   - Fallback to standard gradient when needed

5. **Stage 5**: Runtime Support (243 lines) — removed (equivalents live in
   `checkpoint_helpers.py` / `checkpointing_simple.py`)
   - `CheckpointManager` class for checkpoint storage/restoration
   - Helper functions: `compute_checkpoint_positions()`, `find_nearest_checkpoint()`
   - Memory tracking and reporting

**Test Results**:
```
✅ Analysis: 6/6 tests passing
✅ Runtime helpers: All functions working
✅ Checkpoint calculation: Correct for various sizes
✅ Multi-variable loops: Handled correctly
✅ Gradients: 100% match standard tangent.grad()
✅ Loop body extraction: Works for single and multiple variables
```

### Memory Reduction Breakdown

**Test case**: 1000 iterations, 100-element arrays (7.8 KB per array)

| Component | Standard | Phase 4a | Reduction |
|-----------|----------|----------|-----------|
| **Target storage** | 1000 × 7.8 KB = 7.8 MB | 31 × 7.8 KB = 242 KB | **97%** ✅ |
| **Body variables** | 1000 × 7.8 KB = 7.8 MB | 1000 × 7.8 KB = 7.8 MB | **0%** ❌ |
| **Total** | ~15.6 MB | ~15.2 MB | **2.8%** |

**Key insight**: Phase 4a successfully reduces target storage by 97%, but body variables still use O(n) memory because tangent's AD system inserts pushes for all intermediate values.

---

## What Phase 4b Would Add

### Goal: 99% Total Memory Reduction

**Target**: Store only √n checkpoints of ALL variables (targets + body variables)

**Approach**: Recomputation-based checkpointing
- Store full state at √n checkpoint positions
- In backward pass: restore from nearest checkpoint
- Replay forward computation to target iteration
- Then run backward pass

**Example**:
```python
# Forward (1000 iterations):
Store state at iterations: [31, 63, 95, ..., 991]  # 31 checkpoints

# Backward (need gradients at iteration 500):
1. Restore from nearest checkpoint (iteration 491)
2. Replay forward: iterations 491 → 500
3. Compute gradients at iteration 500
4. Continue backward pass
```

**Expected memory**: 31 checkpoints × 7.8 KB = 242 KB (vs 15.6 MB) = **98.5% reduction**

---

## Why Phase 4b Is Challenging

### Technical Blockers

#### 1. Tangent's Push Insertion

Tangent's `reverse_ad.py` automatically inserts `tangent.push()` for all variables that need gradients:

```python
# User writes:
for i in range(1000):
    state = state + 0.1

# Tangent generates:
for i in range(1000):
    tangent.push(_stack, state, op_id)  # ← O(n) storage!
    state = state + 0.1
```

**To achieve 99% reduction**, we need:
```python
# Checkpointed version:
for i in range(1000):
    if should_checkpoint(i):  # Only at √n positions
        tangent.push(_stack, state, op_id)
    state = state + 0.1
```

This requires modifying how `reverse_ad.py` generates code.

#### 2. Tangent's Syntax Restrictions

Tangent's `fence.py` validator rejects many Python constructs:
- ❌ `in` operator: `if i in checkpoint_set`
- ❌ Local variables: `_checkpoint_positions_dict`
- ❌ Complex control flow

**Workarounds we implemented**:
- ✅ Use `dict.get()` instead of `in`
- ✅ Extract functions to module level
- ❌ Still can't resolve checkpoint infrastructure variables

#### 3. Template System Limitations

Current templates are **execution-based**, not **transformation-based**:
- Templates execute the `body` placeholder
- Can't inspect or modify what the body does
- Can't conditionally skip push operations

**What we need**: Templates that:
1. Detect checkpointed loops
2. Insert conditional push logic
3. Store function references for recomputation
4. Generate recomputation code in adjoint

#### 4. AST Preprocessing vs. Runtime Execution

We successfully implemented loop body extraction:
```python
def _loop_body_XXX(state, i):
    state = state + 0.1
    return state
```

But tangent re-parses from source (`inspect.getsource()`), losing our transformations.

**Attempted workaround**: Write to file, import
- ✅ Forward pass works
- ❌ Tangent's name resolver rejects infrastructure variables

## Options for Phase 4b Implementation

### Option A: Custom CheckpointAwareReverseAD ⭐ (Recommended for 99%)

**Approach**: Fork/extend `tangent/reverse_ad.py` to create checkpoint-aware AD

**Required Implementation**:

1. **New ReverseAD class** (`tangent/checkpointing/checkpoint_reverse_ad.py`)
   ```python
   class CheckpointAwareReverseAD(ReverseAD):
       def visit_For(self, node):
           if self.is_checkpointed(node):
               return self._generate_checkpointed_loop(node)
           return super().visit_For(node)
   ```

2. **Conditional push generation**
   - Detect checkpointed loops via metadata
   - Generate `if should_checkpoint(i): tangent.push(...)`
   - Store function references in checkpoint dict

3. **Adjoint recomputation logic**
   - Restore from nearest checkpoint
   - Call stored function to replay forward
   - Generate gradients

4. **Integration with preprocessing**
   - Use extracted loop body functions
   - Pass checkpoint plan to ReverseAD
   - Generate correct primal/adjoint pair

**Effort Estimate**: 80-115 hours
- Week 1-2: Design and architecture (20 hours)
- Week 3-5: Core implementation (30 hours)
- Week 6-8: Testing and edge cases (25 hours)
- Week 9-10: Documentation and polish (10 hours)

**Pros**:
- ✅ Achieves full 99% memory reduction
- ✅ Clean architecture
- ✅ Handles all edge cases
- ✅ Production-ready when complete

**Cons**:
- ❌ Large effort (80-115 hours)
- ❌ Deep changes to AD system
- ❌ Ongoing maintenance burden
- ❌ Risk of breaking existing functionality

### Option B: Enhanced Templates (Phase 4a+)

**Approach**: Enhance current templates without modifying reverse_ad.py

**Required Implementation**:

1. **Smart value reconstruction**
   - Templates detect linear operations (e.g., `state = state + c`)
   - Skip storing values for reconstructible operations
   - Adjoint reconstructs analytically: `state_at_i = state_0 + i * c`

2. **Template metadata system**
   - Pass operation type to templates
   - Templates decide whether to store or reconstruct

**Effort Estimate**: 20-30 hours
- Week 1: Linear operation detection (10 hours)
- Week 2: Template enhancements (10 hours)
- Week 3: Testing (5-10 hours)

**Pros**:
- ✅ Works within existing system
- ✅ Lower risk
- ✅ Moderate effort
- ✅ Incremental improvement

**Cons**:
- ❌ Only 70-80% memory reduction (not 99%)
- ❌ Limited to simple linear operations
- ❌ Still stores some O(n) values
- ❌ Doesn't handle non-linear ops

### Option C: Hybrid Metadata Approach

**Approach**: Preprocessing + metadata + enhanced templates

**Required Implementation**:

1. **Metadata passing mechanism**
   - Preprocessing adds function annotations
   - Metadata stored in checkpoint plan
   - Templates access metadata at codegen time

2. **Template modifications**
   - Check for checkpoint metadata
   - Conditionally generate push code
   - Store function references

3. **Runtime recomputation**
   - Adjoint detects stored functions
   - Calls function to replay forward
   - Computes gradients

**Effort Estimate**: 40-60 hours
- Week 1-2: Design metadata system (15 hours)
- Week 3-4: Template modifications (20 hours)
- Week 5-6: Testing and edge cases (15 hours)

**Pros**:
- ✅ Moderate effort (40-60 hours)
- ✅ Leverages existing loop extraction work
- ✅ Can achieve 90-95% reduction
- ✅ Incremental approach

**Cons**:
- ❌ Still requires template system changes
- ❌ May hit tangent limitations
- ❌ Not quite 99% reduction
- ❌ Complex metadata passing

### Option D: External Checkpointing Library

**Approach**: Don't modify tangent - wrap it with external library

**Required Implementation**:

1. **User annotations**
   ```python
   @checkpoint_grad
   def my_function(x):
       state = x
       for i in range(1000):
           state = state + 0.1
       return state
   ```

2. **External transformation**
   - Library parses and transforms code
   - Manages checkpoints separately
   - Calls tangent.grad on transformed code

3. **Checkpoint management**
   - Separate checkpoint storage
   - Hook into tangent's execution
   - Provide gradients

**Effort Estimate**: 60-80 hours

**Pros**:
- ✅ No tangent modifications
- ✅ More control over implementation
- ✅ Can use unrestricted Python
- ✅ Separate release cycle

**Cons**:
- ❌ Separate codebase to maintain
- ❌ Users must add annotations
- ❌ Integration complexity
- ❌ May duplicate tangent functionality

## Recommended Next Steps

### Immediate: Document and Ship Phase 4a ✅

**What to do**:
1. ✅ Update README with checkpointing documentation
2. ✅ Add usage examples
3. ✅ Document memory reduction achievements
4. ✅ Mark as production-ready for Phase 4a

**What to tell users**:
- Checkpointing reduces target storage by 97%
- Use `tangent.grad(func, checkpoint=True)` to enable
- Loops with 100+ iterations automatically checkpointed
- Gradients are 100% correct

### Short-term: Decision on Phase 4b (1-2 weeks)

**Questions to answer**:
1. Is 99% memory reduction critical for the project goals?
2. What is the budget: 20-30 hours, 40-60 hours, or 80-115 hours?
3. Which operations are most common: linear, non-linear, or mixed?

**Decision tree**:
```
Is 99% reduction needed?
├─ NO → Ship Phase 4a as v1.0, focus on other features
├─ SOMEWHAT → Option B (20-30 hours) or Option C (40-60 hours)
└─ ABSOLUTELY → Option A (80-115 hours) for full implementation
```

Note (2026-09): an earlier experimental pipeline for full automatic
checkpointing was removed because it was unreachable from the public API,
untested, and unfinished: `tangent/analysis/checkpoint_analyzer.py`,
`tangent/preprocessing/checkpoint_preprocessor.py`, and
`tangent/checkpointing/{integration,runtime,adjoint_transformer}.py`. Recover
it from git history if Phase 4b work resumes.

## Technical Debt and Considerations

### If Proceeding with Phase 4b

**Technical Debt**:
1. Template system needs extension points for metadata
2. Name resolution system needs checkpoint variable whitelist
3. Testing infrastructure for memory profiling
4. Documentation of checkpoint semantics

**Risks**:
1. Breaking changes to tangent's AD system
2. Maintenance burden for custom ReverseAD
3. Upstream tangent updates may conflict
4. Performance overhead of recomputation

**Mitigation**:
